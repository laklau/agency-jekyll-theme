# Agency Jekyll Theme

Welcome to your new Jekyll theme! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your theme into a gem. Put your layouts in `_layouts`, your includes in `_includes` and your sass in `_sass`. To experiment with this code, add some sample content in the yaml files in `_data` and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` – this directory is setup just like a Jekyll site!

[Agency Jekyll Theme](http://github.com/laklau/agency-jekyll-theme/tree/gh-pages) is a jekyll theme gem, the jekyllization by [Adab1ts] (http://github.com/adab1ts) of Agency theme.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

You theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, and `_sass` tracked with Git will be released.

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
